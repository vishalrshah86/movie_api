          This API will be used as the server-side
          component for a movie-focused web application.
          Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
          details about many different movies, directors and genres.
          Users will have the option to create accounts on the site
          that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies.
          This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and
          architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and
          MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods
          like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used
          for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.
